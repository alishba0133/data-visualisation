A Visual Exploration: How the Cost of Living Crisis is Reshaping London's Housing Market

# Data Source:

1. https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/uk-house-price-index

I used the London government website to find data regarding housing in London. I found the dataset UK Property Price Index, which included data on property sales from 1995 through March 2023 as well as average prices by type and borough.

2. https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/housing-london

I found some information from the Greater London Authority analysis of Rightmove's private rental growth for the years 2020 to 2023, as well as data from a YouGov survey of Londoners' housing expenses conducted between January and July 2022.

3. https://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index

The main focus of the Homelet dataset was private renting. It included London's average rent prices as well as their range. Additionally, it included details on London's and the UK's rent-to-income ratio. Because the dataset was so large, I did not use it all. I utilised data on the rent-to-income ratio from 2021 to 2023, the average private rent in London and the UK from 2021 to 2023, and the yearly variance in private rent from May 2022 to May 2023
